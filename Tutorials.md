# Official tutorials #
  * Simple [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) tutorial : will guide you through calling OpenCL kernels with and without the [JavaCL Generator](JavaCLGenerator.md)
  * [Write your first OpenCL Discrete Fourier Transform with JavaCL in 15 minutes](http://ochafik.com/blog/?p=501) : uses the old JNA version of JavaCL (see the [migration page](MigratingFromJNAToBridJ.md))

# Books #
  * [OpenCL in Action](http://www.manning.com/scarpino2/) is clearly the best OpenCL reference and hands-on guide out there, packed with amazing real-world examples ! (and it even covers JavaCL)

  * [Bryan Chung](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/about/) at [Magic & Love Interactive](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/) has done some insane JavaCL-powered [Processing](http://processing.org/) demos:
    * [OpenCL Particles System Example in Processing](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2012/05/01/opencl-particles-system-example-in-processing/)
    * [Paintings from the OpenCL Particles System](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2012/04/30/paintings-from-the-opencl-particles-system/)
    * [OpenCL Particles System with Processing](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2012/04/29/opencl-particles-system-with-processing/)
    * [OpenCL and Processing](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2012/04/23/opencl-and-processing/)
  * [Robert Boothby](http://www.blogger.com/profile/13504207507405859169) has written two very interesting posts about Mandelbrot sets with JavaCL:
    * [Towards a richer GPGPU Mandelbrot Sets and OpenCL example.](http://bbboblog.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/towards-richer-gpgpu-mandelbrot-sets.html)
    * [GPGPU Mandelbrot with OpenCL and Java](http://bbboblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/gpgpu-mandelbrot-with-opencl-and-java.html)
  * [Igor Suhorukov](http://www.blogger.com/profile/14337861739229022768) has detailed how to debug kernels with JavaCL:
    * [OpenCL kernel debugging for java host code](http://suhorukov.blogspot.com/2011/12/opencl-kernel-debugging-for-java-host.html) (also see [this wiki page](DebuggingKernels.md))
  * [GSS Mahadevan](http://www.blogger.com/profile/04178543310367612494) wrote about some JavaCL experiments:
    * [Optimum global/local work size for a given OpenCL kernel](http://mahadevangorti.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/optimum-globallocal-work-size-for-given.html)
    * [Information about OpenCL Global size and Local size dimensions](http://mahadevangorti.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/information-about-opencl-global-size.html)
  * [ImageJDev](http://developer.imagej.net/) has explored GPU acceleration for ImageJ:
    * [GPU Based Processing Techniques and the ImageJ Architecture (Draft 0.2)](http://developer.imagej.net/gpu-based-processing-techniques-and-imagej-architecture-draft-02)
  * [Victor Martins](http://www.pixelnerve.com/v/about/) has published some very cool demos that leverage JavaCL:
    * [MSAOpenCL for Java and Processing](http://www.pixelnerve.com/v/2010/07/29/msaopencl-for-java-and-processing/)
    * [JavaCL, the new OpenCL4Java](http://www.pixelnerve.com/v/2010/02/17/javacl-the-new-opencl4java/)
    * [JavaCL from within Processing 1.0](http://www.pixelnerve.com/v/2009/10/30/opencl-4-java/)
  * Finally, checkout [Olivier Chafik](http://ochafik.com/blog/?s=javacl)'s blog: some contents refers to older version of JavaCL, but all the release notes are there :-)
